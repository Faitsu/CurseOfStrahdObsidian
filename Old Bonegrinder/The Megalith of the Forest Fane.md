The Megaliths can be found behind the [[Old Bonegrinder Windmill]]. This was once the fountain of power and main shrine to [[The Seeker - The Forest Fane]]

```
Behind the bonegrinder are these unkempt,moss covered stones that create somewhat of a circular formation around what seems to be an image of a raven made from stone. Whatever structure this is seems to have been neglected and has deteriorated with the passage of time. Those who know Sylvian can see symbols that resemble this language but yet is not (those who roll a DC 15 int check know that this the language sprawled here is one that probably predates modern Sylvian. It is hard to read all the various symbols, but a word does stand out here: The Seeker ) [Roll religion/investigation checks here] 

Several ravens circle overhead, and one pecks at something on top of the stone that depicts the city of autumn. Upon inspection, the characters see the raven is pecking at a dream pastry, and on the ground in the center of the stone circle is a small pile of childrenâ€™s teeth. [MAKE A RELIGION CHECK, DC 13] The hags placed these here to desecrate the stones and as an offering to the entity they worship, the wicked archfey Ceithlenn of the Crooked Teeth.

The players will need to preform a *ritual* here and have the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] to purify the shrine and empower the Fane 

By the megaliths is a cellar door that leads back into the basement of the Windmill
