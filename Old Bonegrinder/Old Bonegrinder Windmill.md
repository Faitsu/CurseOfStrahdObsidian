Originally known as the Durst Windmill, this grain windmill became the home to three night hags: [[Morgantha]] and her wretched daughters, [[Bella Sunbane]] and [[Offalia Wormwiggle]]. The hags are trapped in Barovia, but they like it here. Using their Change Shape action to look like Barovian women — a frumpy mother and her two homely daughters — the hags snatch children, devour them, and use the windmill’s grindstone to crush their little bones into powder. This powder is a key ingredient in the hags’ dream pastries, which they offer to Barovian adults who are desperate to escape Strahd’s domain.

Made with the bones of the innocent, the hags’ dream pastries allow Barovians to enter a trance, wherein they can escape to heavenly places full of joy. When adults can no longer afford the hag’s dream pastries, the hags offer to trade their pastries for the Barovians’ children, thus preying on the adults’ selfishness while acquiring the ingredients they need to make more pastries. This is how the hags sow corruption in Strahd’s domain and why they don’t take the children by force. The hags are interested only in children who have souls. They prick each child with a needle; if the child cries, that’s a sign that the infant has a soul.

**Description:** 
```
The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

As you get close, you can see that the onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building’s interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks at you, seemingly agitated.

Closet with morgantha potions: 
The first elixir, labeled “Youth,” is a golden syrup that magically makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours. The second elixir, labeled “Laughter,” is a nonmagical red tea that infects the imbiber with cackle fever (see “[Diseases](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Diseases "Diseases")” in chapter 8, “Running the Game,” of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")). The third elixir, a greenish milky liquid labeled “Mother’s Milk,” is actually a dose of [pale tincture](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/145-pale-tincture-ingested) (see “[Poisons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Poisons "Poisons")” in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")).
