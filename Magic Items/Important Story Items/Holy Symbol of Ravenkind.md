The [Holy Symbol of Ravenkind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5529-holy-symbol-of-ravenkind) is a unique holy symbol sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia. It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana’s passing.

The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.

- Was actually gifted to the people of Barovia by [[The Seeker - The Forest Fane]] to ward off evil

- Can be found under an evil tree
