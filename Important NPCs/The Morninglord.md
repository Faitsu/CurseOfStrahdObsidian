The Morning Lord is a mysterious figure who many Barovians worship as a symbol of hope and protection against Strahd and his forces. 

The Morninglord is the god of the rosy dawn that marks the end of every night. The deity asks little of his followers, save that they treat each other with kindness and retain hope in their hearts. This humble faith holds great appeal for those who have little more than hope and kindness to offer, and the cult is spreading rapidly among the downtrodden Gundarikites of Barovia. Its simple teachings conceal a message of intense hope. No matter how bleak the future may seem, no matter how dark the night, the dawn will come. Many of the Morninglord's followers follow a prophecy that, someday, the Morninglord will return once again to lead the world into the daylight.

Due to the history of the true Morninglord being lost to time, there is much speculation on who this figure is. 

Some people think the figure is a woman (based off Lux from Iredesca), or of Lathander (From Faerun).
