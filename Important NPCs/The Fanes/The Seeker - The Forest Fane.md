Strahd's Influence: 

- The desecration of the Forest Fane is actually how the hags of Old Bonegrinder first got their start in Barovia.
    
- Strahd knew that ravens were a particularly important and sacred animal to the natives of the valley. In the early days of his time in Barovia, Strahd found the [[Hags]] coven and bade them to bake ravens into pies and feed them, unknowingly, to the masses of Barovia. Strahd personally caught the ravens, presented them to the shrine of the Forest Fane, and snapped the birds' necks before bringing the carcasses to the hags. He did this for a year.
    
- At the end of the year, Strahd gained the power of the Forest Fane. Though he never told the hags the reason for this long term ritual, he gifted the coven with the land surrounding the Forest shrine for their service, including the remains of Old Bonegrinder. Morgontha's grandmother was one of the original hags who conducted this ritual.

Her Shrine:

Her shrine is the [[The Megalith of the Forest Fane]]
