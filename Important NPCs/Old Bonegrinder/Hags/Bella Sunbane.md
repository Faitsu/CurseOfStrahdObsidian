- Found on first floor and is the front woman to the bakery operation at the bonegrinder windmill. Though not many travel to their home, she welcomes travelers to the bakery she has set up on the first floor. 
- Her true goal is to lure travelers into telling her their deepest darkest secrets so she can make deals with them, or to have innocent adventurers get her more children so they can make more pastries
- Possible Scenarios: 
	- If players ask her about the megaliths behind the windmill, she will say her mother would tell her that the stones were relics of the past, and that they were used by people for archaic rituals to old beings of power
	- If players bring up the durst family windmill deed, she will frown and get defensive, saying that they are trying to kick out these women who want to make an honest living
	- She will try to coax the players to eat some pastries and prompt them for information
