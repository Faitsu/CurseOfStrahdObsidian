_Dearest Morgantha,_

Your messenger arrived at my hut with your... _request_. How quaint that you and your daughters believe yourselves entitled to share in the fruits of my labors. The gem I have acquired through considerable effort and sacrifice is not some trinket to be divided among your coven like stolen sweets.

This gem serves a purpose far grander than your petty schemes. My Lord Strahd has need of power—true power—to secure his dominion over these mist-shrouded lands. The gem's energy will serve to breathe life into bones that have rested too long in their silver tomb.

The gem remains mine, as does my unwavering loyalty to the master of Castle Ravenloft.
Content yourself with your pastries and your fey magics.

Regards

**Baba Lysaga**  
_Mother of Strahd_

_P.S. - Do give my regards to dear Bella and Offalia. I trust they are keeping busy with their... baking._
